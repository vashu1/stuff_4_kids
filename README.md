## [arduino_morse](https://github.com/vashu1/arduino_morse)

This code can be used for turning Arduino into morse learning gadget or for adding morse functionality into existing Arduino project. It uses state machine design, so it would be easy to merge with your code.

[CW Keyer](http://blog.radioartisan.com/arduino-cw-keyer/) is a good alternative for a serious project.

## [gravity](https://github.com/vashu1/gravity)

2D planet simulator. It was written in Flash, so I guess it is obsolete now.
