[Here is my scan of Google Maps sattelite image of the Earth - it's 250 MB!](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2nikw9egjxt306d/world_sattelite_final.png?dl=0)

I printed it on 2 A4 pages and laminated with A3 sheet. To cut screenshot to A4 parts I used [this script](python3 cut_image_to_a4.py).

Set `img` to your saved screenshot path and change `start` and `scale` parameters to get result that you want.

You can use default settings on whole Earth image mentioned above.
