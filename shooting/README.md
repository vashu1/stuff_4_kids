# Wooden peg crossbow.

Are you bored being stuck at home? Hunt house flies!

Take wooden peg, do [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3zLnEtrq4c) and you have appropriate weapon. It can pierce piece of paper or apple.

Ballistic pendulum made from 17 g piece of apple on 45 cm thread deviated 12 mm after being shot, and arrow weights ~0.09 g. According to my calculation muzzle energy was 3e-05 J and muzzle velocity ~ 0.8 m/s (so you can literally walk away from missile) !

Now it is time for a hunt. Find a fly, carefully approach, take aim and shoot. It is best to get at least 1 cm close, if you game is too cautious - bait it on a piece of paper and shoot from below.

Always wear eye googles and do not forget about gun safety rules! (though tests on eyes of dead fish showed that arrow can't pierce cornea)
